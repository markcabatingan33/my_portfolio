    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hey there! I'm Mark Julvin L. Cabatingan, 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate web developer with a knack for crafting responsive and dynamic websites. I specialize in front-end and back-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I began with a curiosity about how websites work behind the scenes. I quickly became fascinated by the process of bringing design and functionality together to create engaging user experiences. I've been continuously improving my skills in web technologies and have worked on some projects that challenge and inspire me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm still learning and have a knowledge of various techniques, tools, and frameworks to keep up with the ever-evolving tech landscape. Whether it's building interactive websites with JavaScript or crafting server-side solutions with PHP.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I play basketball, playing online games and watching movies. Feel free to explore my portfolio to check out some of my work. If you have any questions or want to collaborate, don't hesitate to reach out. I'd love to connect!
